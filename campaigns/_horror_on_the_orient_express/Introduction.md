# 4 years before professor smith calls the Investigators to The Challenger Banquet

## Scenario Edge of Darkness

A British scholar named **Professor Smith** contacts **Camilla Moretti** in the **Summer of 1919**. He asks her to investigate the story of the preternatural as he is only in the states for a very short time. He came to the States to visit the **Society for Exploration of the Unexplained (SEU)**. 

Camilla Moretti is the Heiress to her father’s crime family. Her father, Vigo, sees no harm in letting her look into the situation and later to go to chase down mysteries in Europe. Some day she will be called on to lead and Vigo Moretti sees it as an opportunity for her to learn. Her interest in the occult and scholarship is a main driver for the campaign.

# The investigators
Still, he sends his men to protect her. They are led by the well read mob surgeon **Scotty “Doctor Doc” Musoliny** (played by Chanse). The locksmith and muscle is the ever useful **“Dr. Hands”** (played by Steve and not a doctor). The criminal lawyer **Frank “Slim” Miskatoni** (played by Nacho). The backup muscle is **Hank “The Face” Braddock**.

## Seeing is believing

Camilla drags the begrudging mobsters to meet with Dr. Merriweather at the behest of Professor Smith. They meet Smith at a cafe and have a pleasant meal before rushing off. This is just 3 months before his wife Edith dies.
Upon meeting Merriweather at the hospital, he shows the investigators a golden sarcophagus a foot long with Voorish Script inside. 
They vaguely recall that the Voors were a supposed malevolent race from pre-history that worship dark gods like Old Worm and The Skinless God
