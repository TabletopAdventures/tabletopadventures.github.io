# The Grand Bazaar Incident

*"Sometimes the most dangerous creatures are the ones that need our help the most."*

## A Dragon in Distress

The team's second day on the job began with an emergency call that would test their compassion and problem-solving skills in ways they never expected. The **Grand Bazaar**, the city's bustling central marketplace, had erupted into panic, and the M&M Field Team was needed immediately.

### The Scene of Panic

Upon arriving at the Grand Bazaar, the team found a scene of complete chaos. Merchants were fleeing their stalls, customers were running in all directions, and in the center of the main square lay the source of all the commotion: a young green dragon, curled up in what appeared to be a deep slumber.

The dragon was massive compared to the fleeing citizens, but something about its posture suggested it wasn't sleeping peacefully. The creature seemed to be trembling slightly, and its breathing was shallow and irregular. The team quickly realized this wasn't a typical dragon encounter - this was a creature in distress.

### Securing the Area

The team immediately sprang into action, working to de-escalate the panic and create a safe perimeter around the sleeping dragon. **Necromis** and **Kaeron** took charge of crowd control, using their imposing presence to gently but firmly guide the panicked merchants and customers to safety.

**"Birb"** and **"The Untitled"** focused on establishing a secure perimeter, ensuring that no one could accidentally disturb the dragon while the team assessed the situation. Their quick thinking and coordination helped restore some semblance of order to the chaotic scene.

### The Awakening

As the team worked to secure the area, they noticed the dragon beginning to stir. The creature's eyes fluttered open, revealing large, anxious eyes that darted around nervously. When the team approached cautiously, the dragon let out a small, frightened whimper and tried to curl up even tighter.

The team quickly realized that this dragon was not a threat - it was terrified. Through gentle gestures and calming words, they managed to communicate with the creature, who introduced himself as **Mossy**. The young dragon explained that he had become separated from his parents during a violent thunderstorm and had been wandering lost and frightened.

### The Fainting Incident

As the team continued to talk with Mossy, **"The Untitled"** made the mistake of asking about his parents. The question caused the young dragon to become overwhelmed with emotion, and he promptly fainted from distress, collapsing in a heap in the middle of the square.

The team quickly sprang into action, using their combined skills to rouse the unconscious dragon. **Necromis** used his calming presence to reassure Mossy, while **"Birb"** used their mysterious powers to help stabilize the dragon's emotional state. Through their combined efforts, they managed to bring Mossy back to consciousness.

### The Flight to Safety

With Mossy awake but still clearly distressed, the team knew they needed to get him to safety. The dragon was too large and too frightened to walk through the city streets, so **"The Untitled"** and **"Birb"** volunteered to fly with Mossy to the Field Operations Building.

The flight was tense but successful. Mossy, despite his fear, trusted the team enough to allow them to guide him through the air. The sight of a dragon flying over the city with two small figures clinging to its back was certainly unusual, but it was the safest way to transport the distressed creature.

### Meeting with Captain Thornfield

Upon arriving at the Field Operations Building, the team was met by **Captain Mildred Thornfield**, who was clearly not expecting to see a dragon in her training yard. The debriefing was tense, with the Captain initially reluctant to allow a dragon to remain on the premises.

However, after hearing the team's explanation and seeing Mossy's clearly distressed state, Captain Thornfield begrudgingly agreed to provide temporary shelter for the young dragon. She made it clear that this was a temporary arrangement and that the team would be responsible for finding a permanent solution.

### The Investigation

With Mossy safely secured in the training yard, the team began the process of trying to help him find his way home. Through careful questioning, they learned that Mossy's home was in a deep forest near a wide river, with a unique landmark he called the "Sun-Pillar."

The team was initially stumped by this description, but **Kaeron** remembered a Dragonborn map from a previous mission. When he produced the map, **Necromis**, being Dragonborn himself, immediately recognized a landmark labeled "Veyl-Kestrath" and confirmed its translation as "The Sun's Pillar" - a known draconic nesting ground.

### The Breakthrough

This discovery was a major breakthrough. The team now had a confirmed location for Mossy's home, and they could begin planning how to reunite the young dragon with his parents. The map provided crucial information about the area's geography and the best routes to reach the Sun-Pillar.

Mossy was overjoyed at the news, though he remained anxious about the journey ahead. The team assured him that they would help him get home safely, and they began making plans for the expedition.

## Session Conclusion

As the second session drew to a close, the team had successfully contained a potentially dangerous situation and turned it into an opportunity to help a creature in need. They had learned valuable lessons about compassion, problem-solving, and the importance of looking beyond appearances.

The discovery of Mossy's home location marked a significant milestone in their mission, and they were now faced with the challenge of planning a journey to reunite a lost dragon with his family. It was a task that would test their skills and determination, but one that they were committed to seeing through to the end.
