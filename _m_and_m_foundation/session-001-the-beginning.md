# Welcome to the M&M Field Team

*"Your first day starts with a garden full of screaming flowers and a tavern in chaos."*

## The New Recruits

Fresh from their training, four new agents arrive at the **I.C. University** to join the **Mundane Mayhem & Magical Mischief Containment Team**. Little do they know that their first day on the job would begin with immediate action.

### The Team
- **Kaeron** - A tiefling rogue with perhaps too much enthusiasm for grappling
- **Necromis** - A dragonborn barbarian with a calm demeanor
- **"Birb"** - A kenku warlock with mysterious powers
- **"The Untitled"** - A tiefling bard with a flair for the dramatic

## The University Gardens Incident

No sooner had the new recruits arrived at the university than panic erupted across the campus. The **University Gardens** had become a scene of pure chaos - every single flower had somehow climbed out of the ground and was running around like crazed toddlers, creating a colorful but dangerous situation.

The team was immediately dispatched to contain the situation. Their mission: coral and capture the rogue flowers and re-plant them safely back in the ground.

### The Containment Operation

The operation began with careful attempts to gently guide the flowers back to their beds. However, **Kaeron** proved to be a bit too enthusiastic in their grappling attempts. When they grabbed a handful of the fleeing flowers, the plants let out horrifying screams that echoed across the gardens, followed by a brilliant flash of sparkles and glitter.

Miraculously, despite the dramatic display, the players found themselves completely unharmed by the magical outburst. The glitter settled harmlessly around them as they continued their work.

Through teamwork and determination, the team eventually managed to contain all the rogue flowers and successfully re-plant them in their proper locations. The gardens were restored to their peaceful state, though the memory of screaming flowers would haunt the team for some time.

## Meeting Captain Thornfield

With the garden crisis resolved, the team finally had the opportunity to meet **Captain Mildred Thornfield**, their commanding officer. The introduction was brief but professional, as Captain Thornfield wasted no time in getting the new recruits oriented to their duties.

The team introduced themselves properly, each bringing their unique skills and personalities to the M&M Field Team. Captain Thornfield seemed pleased with their performance in the garden incident, though she noted that perhaps a bit more finesse might be beneficial in future operations.

## The Tipping Tankard Crisis

No sooner had the introductions concluded than another emergency call came in. The **Tipping Tankard**, a popular tavern in the city, had erupted into complete chaos, and the team was needed immediately.

### The Scene of Chaos

Upon arriving at the tavern, the team found a scene of absolute pandemonium:

- **Sentient Brooms**: The tavern's brooms had become self-aware and were aggressively trying to do their jobs by "cleaning" up the patrons - essentially trying to sweep them right out the door. They were also attempting to serve drinks, though their broom-like nature made this rather ineffective.

- **Flying Trinkets**: A collection of small items - shoes, cutlery, dishes, and other tavern accessories - had taken flight and were zooming around the establishment, being generally obnoxious and dangerous.

- **Exploding Pies**: Several pies that had been in the process of being eaten had suddenly become volatile, randomly exploding and leaving pools of sticky goop scattered throughout the tavern.

### The Containment Strategy

The team was tasked with getting the situation under control while causing minimal property damage and ensuring no casualties. This required careful planning and creative problem-solving.

**The Solution**: Through quick thinking, the team discovered that the various animated objects could be neutralized by grappling them and then throwing them into the exploded pie goop. The sticky substance would trap the objects until they eventually settled down and returned to their normal, inanimate state.

### The Operation

The team worked together to:
- Grapple the aggressive brooms and subdue them in the pie goop
- Capture the flying trinkets and stick them in the sticky mess
- Contain the remaining animated objects using the same method

Through careful coordination and teamwork, the team successfully restored order to the Tipping Tankard. The patrons were grateful, the property damage was minimal, and the team had successfully completed their first major containment operation.

## Session Conclusion

As the first session drew to a close, the team had proven themselves capable of handling the bizarre and chaotic nature of their new job. They had successfully contained two major magical incidents, learned to work together as a team, and gotten their first taste of what life as M&M Field Team agents would be like.

The team had also learned some valuable lessons about the importance of finesse in their approach, the value of creative problem-solving, and the fact that in this line of work, you never quite knew what kind of magical mayhem you might encounter next.
